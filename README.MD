# Description of the project
The ABC Tune Database System is (written in python) to manage and search collections of traditional music in ABC notation format. It provides an effective approach towards the organization, storage, and querying of large libraries of folk tunes, jigs, reels, and other similar traditional music pieces.

# Instructions for use
When you see the main menu, simply type the number of the option you want (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) and press Enter. On your first run, you must type 4 and press Enter to load your ABC files into the database. The program will scan your abc_books folder and import all the tunes, showing you progress as it works. After the files are loaded, the menu will appear again. Now you can search for tunes by typing 1 followed by your search term, browse tunes by book number with option 2, or filter by rhythm type using option 3. For example, if you want to find all jigs, type 3, press Enter, then type jig and press Enter again. The results will display in a table format, and the menu will reappear so you can perform another search. Option 5 shows you statistics about your collection, and when you're finished, type 6 to exit the program.

# How it works:
The ABC Tune Database System is a program that takes music files written in ABC notation (a text-based music format) and organizes them into a searchable database. It works by reading files from your computer, extracting important information about each tune, storing everything in a database, and then letting you search through your collection quickly and easily.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

I am most proud of creating a fully working database application from scratch. This project isn't just a simple script - it's a complete system that can handle hundreds or thousands of music tunes, organize them efficiently, and make them easily searchable. Seeing all the different components work together seamlessly - from file parsing to database storage to user interaction - gives me a real sense of accomplishment.

# What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to work with SQLite databases to store and retrieve data efficiently, and how to use Pandas for searching and filtering information. I gained experience in reading and parsing text files, navigating folder structures programmatically, and handling different file encodings. I also learned the importance of creating clear user interfaces with proper error handling so the program doesn't crash when users make mistakes. Most importantly, I learned how to combine different programming concepts - file operations, databases, data analysis, and user interaction - into one complete working system, which taught me how real applications are built and structured.
